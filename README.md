### Hey, I'm YiÄŸit - aka Arintia. 

## I'm a software developer from Turkey. Game development is my passion, however, I'm focused on MERN stack web development.

- ðŸ’» I'm currently working on an authentication boilerplate using the MERN stack and [PassportJS](https://www.passportjs.org/). Once it's done, it'll be completely open source.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
- âœ… I want to collab with other developers, and I'd like to help others achieve their dreams.
- ðŸŽ¯ 2022 goal: To get better at JavaScript, data structures and front end web development. Have projects to show off my knowledge.
