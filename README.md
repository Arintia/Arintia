## Hey, I'm Yiğit - aka Arintia. 

### I'm a software developer from Turkey. I'm focused on MERN stack web development currently. I do game dev on the side as a hobby.

- 💻 I'm currently working on a simple chat app using the MERN stack. Once it's done, it'll be completely open source.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).
- 👨‍💻 I share my learning journey with the world on Medium. You can check [my Medium profile](https://medium.com/@yigitatak) for my articles.  
- ✅ I'm an open-source enthusiast. I'll try to release as many of my applications as I can open-source so that the software community at large can benefit from it.
- Ask me anything JavaScript, TypeScript and React!
