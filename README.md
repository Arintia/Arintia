## Hey, I'm Yiğit - aka Arintia. 

### I'm a software developer from Turkey. I'm focused on MERN stack web development currently.

- 💻 I'm currently working on a simple chat app using the MERN stack. Once it's done, it'll be completely open source.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
- 👨‍💻 I share my learning journey with the world on Medium. You can check [my Medium profile](https://medium.com/@yigitatak) for my articles.  
- ✅ My plan is to collab with other developers on GitHub, get new connections and contribute to open source projects to my best ability.
- 🎯 My 2022 goal is to get better at JavaScript(specifically async), data structures and React.
